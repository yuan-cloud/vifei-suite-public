# A2 Investigation-Flow UX Audit (Desktop + Narrow) · 2026-02-17

## Scope

Bead: `bd-18m`

Workflows audited:

1. First-run orientation
2. Incident triage
3. Forensic drill-down
4. Share-safe refusal recovery

Evidence source:

```bash
OUT_DIR=.tmp/a2-ux-audit FASTLANE_MAX_SECONDS=1200 scripts/e2e/fastlane.sh
```

## Evidence snapshots

- Desktop Incident Lens: `docs/assets/readme/incident-lens.txt`
- Narrow Incident Lens (72 col): `docs/assets/readme/incident-lens-narrow-72.txt`
- Desktop Forensic Lens: `docs/assets/readme/forensic-lens.txt`
- Refusal UX text: `docs/assets/readme/export-refusal.txt`
- Fastlane stage log: `.tmp/a2-ux-audit/run.jsonl`

## Workflow findings

### 1) First-run orientation

- Desktop and narrow both show onboarding strip:
  - `First run: Tab switch lens | q quit`
  - `Forensic controls: j/k move, Enter expand`
- Assessment: good initial discoverability, deterministic wording.

### 2) Incident triage

- Desktop includes explicit "Next action" guidance line after anomaly list.
- Narrow view does not reliably retain an equivalent explicit guidance line when vertical budget is tight.
- Assessment: narrow operators can lose immediate "what to do next" instruction at the exact point of triage.

### 3) Forensic drill-down

- Timeline + inspector split is clear on desktop.
- Guidance exists (`Enter=expand`, `j/k`) and ordering appears deterministic.
- Assessment: desktop flow is strong; narrow mode depends on entering forensic from incident with less explicit bridge guidance.

### 4) Refusal recovery

- Refusal output is structured and actionable (`code=EXPORT_REFUSED`, blocked items, refusal-report path).
- Current blocked list can repeat same pattern/value combination multiple times.
- Assessment: still useful, but duplicate rows increase scan cost when operators just need first corrective step.

## Top friction point (selected)

Top friction by time-to-answer impact:

- **Narrow incident triage loses compact next-step guidance at decision moment.**

Reasoning:

- This is the entry path for first-time and on-call users.
- If "what to do next" is not consistently visible in narrow layouts, users spend extra cycles discovering navigation semantics.
- The fix is low-risk and deterministic: preserve a compact action hint under narrow width constraints.

## Recommended next implementation (A2-6)

Implement one UX lever only:

- In Incident Lens anomalies section, guarantee a compact narrow-safe next-action hint remains visible.
- Keep desktop message unchanged or near unchanged.
- Preserve deterministic rendering behavior and existing key bindings.

## Acceptance checks for next bead

- New/updated test proving narrow render includes compact action hint.
- Existing modality and Truth HUD tests remain green.
- No changes to deterministic artifact formats.
