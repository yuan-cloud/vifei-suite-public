# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open public issues for potential vulnerabilities.

Send a private report with:

- affected version or commit
- impact assessment
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- any suggested mitigation

Use one of these channels:

- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- private maintainer contact if advisory tooling is unavailable

Preferred advisory URL:

- `https://github.com/yuan-cloud/vifei-suite/security/advisories/new`

## Scope

High-priority security areas for this project:

- secret redaction and export refusal paths
- deterministic artifact integrity and hash validation
- share-safe export boundaries
- credential/token leakage through logs or artifacts

## Response expectations

- Initial acknowledgement target: 72 hours
- Triage and severity assignment after reproduction
- Fix timeline depends on severity and release risk

## Disclosure

Please allow time for a fix before public disclosure.
Coordinated disclosure is preferred.
